# bitburner-command-and-controll

This is my little collection of scripts for grinding Bitburner.

## Start
```bash
# run cc.js
```
For normal runtime. 
If you want to charge any fragments your have or share computing power etc use the flags 'share' or 'charge' with the desired amount of ram as a percent value.
```bash
# run cc.js share .2 charge .35
```
Take a look at
```bash
# run cc.js help
```
For further config options.

Also, the file 'core/globals.js' contains basic settings.

## Debug / Inspect
```bash
# run cmd.js help
```

For a list of helpful commands to inspect your C&C instance or the game environment.
